# ECEN-361-STM32-Lab-08-Sampling-Solution

## Overview / Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the student to DAC output, DMAs, and the tradeoffs in timing and sampling.  This lab will be done in two parts -- this is the first, which focuses on the Analog Output.  


All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions [HERE](./Documentation/Working_with_Labs_from_Github_Classroom_Repository.pdf).

Open and follow the instructions found in the WORD document in your cloned repo: 

>``/Documentation/ECEN-361-Lab-08-ADC-DAC-DMA.docx``

Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github.   The commit will upload this word document as well and serves as the lab submission.   (Note:  MSWord is assumed to be available.  IF you don't have MSWord to edit this document, talk with the professor or T/A.)

After committing and pushing to github, be sure to finish the assignment by pasting the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.
