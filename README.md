# ECEN-361-STM32-Lab-08-Part2-DAC-ADC-Sampling

## BYU-I  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
<!-- div style="text-align: right">Initially Written:  Fall-2023   LRW</div> -->

## Overview / Purpose
This lab continues the previous week's introduction of ADC and sampling and the tradeoffs inherent in a microcontroller-based system with analog I/O.  

All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions [HERE](./Documentation/Working_with_Labs_from_Github_Classroom_Repository.pdf).

Open and follow the instructions found in the WORD document in your cloned repo: 

>/Documentation/Assignment.md

Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github. The commit will upload this document as well and serves as the lab submission.

After committing and pushing to github, be sure to finish the assignment by pasting the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.  


## Resources Used
For plotting from the USART2 out, there are two software options suggested:
*  **Arduino Plotter**  Required in previous ECEN classes, it's likely that this is already installed.  We'll use the "Serial Plotter" option in Arduino.  Note that BYU-I WiFi often blocks Arduino sites an S/W and installation via campus may not be possible.

<br>

*  **SerialPlotter** is another free, plotting software that will be shown in the lab.  [SerialPlotter LINK HERE](https://hackaday.io/project/5334-serialplot-realtime-plotting-software)

<br>

*  **Saleae Logic Analyzer** with Analog channel.   This is available for the in-person classes.  For online, other types of digitizing capture tools work fine, but there must be an analog channel.
